  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal information such as names,
    email addresses, phone numbers, or payment information. The App may access certain device
    features (e.g., motion tracking or controllers) solely to provide core functionality. All
    such data is processed locally on the device and is not transmitted or stored externally.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
  <p>
    Any data generated while using the App is used only to support the App’s intended functionality.
    We do not use this data for advertising, analytics, or user tracking.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not collect or store user data, there is no personal information to retain. If you
    believe that we may have inadvertently collected data from you, you may request deletion at any time
    by contacting us via the email address below. We will promptly investigate and delete any such data.
    All users, regardless of location, may request data deletion free of charge.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

    The App is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
    information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and will
    be effective when published.
